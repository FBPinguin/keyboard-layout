# keyboard-layout
My keyboard layout for the Corne V4 keyboard. \
The config is for the [vial](https://get.vial.today/) software.

If you don't have a Corne v4 keyboard and would still like to use the symbol-layer. \
I made a [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) config that uses the LAlt and RAlt key to simulate the experience of having a symbol layer.

## Overall layout

## Layer 2 (Symbol layer)
Heavily inspired by [this article](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/symbol-layer/index.html) \

## Layer 3 (movement keys + function keys & other macro's)
